## Decryption 

**Idea**: Cryptography is the study of algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages between senders and receivers. Decryption is used in many places that we may or may not be aware of like when we use the phone, when we make transactions online, and more prominently today in blockchain.


### Methodology

1. Create a Transition Probability Matrix on Plain Text
2. Define Log-Likelihood
3. Decipher using the Metropolis Algorithm


### Execution

Open the jupyter notebook named: metro_decyphir.ipynb. To run each cell, press Shift+Enter. Make sure to run them sequentially because each cell depends on the one before it.
